> &ldquo;a loss of self-confidence and feeling of anxiety or disappointment that can occur in early middle age.&rdquo;

It's been happening for a while. The slow realisation that age is creeping up on me.

Every time I go for a haircut there are noticeably more grey hairs than the time before; I feel the aches in my back a little more than a used to; My knees make more noises than they did last year.

I could go on, but I'm sure you get the idea.

Then, suddenly and quite without realising, I found myself searching terms such as [&ldquo;what is a midlife crisis&rdquo;](https://www.google.co.uk/search?safe=off&ei=nxJPXKvBEdOj1fAP6O2-iAE&q=what+is+a+midlife+crisis&oq=what+is+a+mid&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0i20i263j0l9.11054.12443..13179...0.0..0.66.690.13......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i67j0i131i67j0i131j0i10i67.p36vaDOyC7s) or [&ldquo;when does a mid-life crisis start&rdquo;](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=when+does+a+mid-life+crisis+start&oq=when+does+a+mid-life+crisis+start&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4.485j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

```[What has this lead me to]```

```[Family 'manifesto' has fed into this]```

### What is the family 'manifesto'?

> manifesto <br />
> /manɪˈfɛstəʊ/ <br />
> noun <br />
> a public declaration of policy and aims, especially one issued before an election by a political party or candidate.

Simply put it's a list of items that we, as a family, have &rdquo;signed up to&ldquo; and agreed to try &amp; achieve.

I'm not going to be making this list _fully_ public, but it includes items such as:

* Be debt free, as much as possible, before we hit _xx_ age
* Plan for 40th birthday
* Live abroad

## Bucket list

At a guess, I'd say that most folks have some kind of list in their heads -- whether they'd admit to it remains to be seen -- of things they'd like to see/do/experience before the end.

And I'm no different; For instance, those close to me know that it is a massive ambition to live &amp; work in Australia, I'd also love to go travelling (probably not as much of a backpacker now, though) and there is a huge list of countries/places/sights that I wish to see, some of which are listed below.

Enter...

### 40before

It's probably obvious, but it's simply a play on the 40 things before you die etc. I consciously kept it vague as I don't want the list to stop at 40, for me, that is where it starts and I'm hoping that it will be something that will continue to evolve and grow over time, after all, there is no reason why it has to stop at 40 things, right?!

### My current list

I've not quite got 40, but, as it stands here is my current list:

1. Live and work in Australia (This will always be my ultimate goal)
