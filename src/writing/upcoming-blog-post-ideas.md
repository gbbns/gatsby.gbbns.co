My hope is that this page will serve as an ongoing scratchpad for future blog posts ideas. I have a few ideas for blog posts, some contencious, others more my own folly.

I'd love to get peoples feedback on some of the topics mentioned below; I also intend to link to draft posts with the aim of getting constructive feedback during the writing process.

## Initial topics include:

* Fullstack: The Myth and the Bullshit
* [End of year -- 2017 -- review](/writing/2017-review)
* [Goals and plans for 2018](/writing/2018-preview)
* Accessibility at Auto Trader
* Breaking into public speaking
* Digital detox - My "dry" january
* Benefits of having a mentor, or being a mentor
* Conference round ups: <a href="https://www.wearesigma.com/campdigital/2018/" rel="noopener">Camp Digital</a> and <a href="https://uxscotland.net/2018/" rel="noopener">UX Scotland</a>
* Designing, and building, in the open.

## Shorter posts/notes:

* Starting a guild
* Levelling up - skills you pickup as you climb the ladder
* Retros
