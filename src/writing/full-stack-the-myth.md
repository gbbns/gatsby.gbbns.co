My plan is to write this post in the open, in the meantime these are my current thoughts on the subject.

## Current thoughts

* FE is a spectrum
	* UX <----> HTML/CSS <----> JS/Engineering
* Everyone has forgotten about standards
* More than `just HTML`
	* What about accessibility?
	* Performance anyone?
	* Cross browser testing...
	* Devices! Devices! Devices!
	* Sass, CSS & pattern libraries
	* Build tools
	* Linting
* It's no longer about converting a design to a template, we've got more intelligent in our approach, the bredth of FE has grown massively and as such...
* So, let me ask you, are you _really_ fullstack?
