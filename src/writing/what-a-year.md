It's now February 2016, almost a year to the day that Samuel was born, and things are only just beginning to slow down enough to actually gather my thoughts from the last 12 months.

I always knew that 2015 was going to be a stand-out year due to the fact that fatherhood was impending... But I had no idea _just_ how much of a year it _would_ actually be.

January brought about a mandatory period of abstinence from alcohol, partly due to the yearly Christmas excess, but mainly due to being 'on-call' for a trip to the hospital.

In the wee small hours of 4th February, this prospect became a very real possibility as my wife started with contractions, cue an emergency spell of working from home to keep an eye on proceedings.

As the day wore on things slowed, that is until 18:20, that was the moment things started.

Then, on the morning of February 5th 2015 at 09:57am, my little boy was born, from this moment *everything* changed.

The other notable event that happened was my change of jobs.

This was a _*huge*_ event for me -- not quite as big as becoming a dad, however -- as after being with the amazing [Code Computerlove](https://www.codecomputerlove.com) for a little over *7.5* years, I decided to accept an offer at [Zuto](https://www.zuto.com).

Still doing front end work, but now working _as_ part of a dedicated in-house team, rather than _for_ an in house team.

Obviously other things happened throughout the year, but they aren't for sharing, not for now at any rate.

All I can say, is _wow_, what a year.
