Part 1: The plan &amp; the dream

For as long as I can remember I've wanted to go to Australia. Now some folks don't understand my desire to go, but it's something deep rooted in me that I _have_ to go.

On 1st October 2018 I finally got the chance to head out there.

As with most trips it needed some planning. I was going to be travelling with an old school friend who I've known pretty much all my life. He was to be spending 6 weeks out there, but for the first two weeks we'd be travel buddies.

We traded ideas for a while, shared many blog posts we'd read and gleaned ideas from (all of which I'll share at the end), and eventually settled on the following itinerary, and whilst not perfect for everyone it fitted what we wanted to achieve pretty well.
