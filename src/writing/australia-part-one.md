## The plan &amp; the dream

For as long as I can remember I've wanted to go to Australia. Now some folks don't understand my desire to go, but it's something deep rooted in me that I _have_ to go.

Looking back, I think it stems from having an "_Auntie Joan who lives in Australia_". As a child it was amazing to hear stories of this far off land, and being a child of the 80's back then it _really_ was a far away place.

I also put a large part of the blame on [Sir Michael Palin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Palin) and his dazzling array of travel programmes, ["Full Circle with Michael Palin"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Circle_with_Michael_Palin) being the main culprit, with special reference to [Episode Six: Australia/New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Circle_with_Michael_Palin#Episode_Six:_Australia/New_Zealand)

### Dreams can come true?

On 1st October 2018 I finally got the chance to head out there and put my years of dreaming into action.

As with most trips it needed some planning. I was going to be travelling with an old school friend - who I've known pretty much all my life. He was to be spending 6 weeks out there, but for the first two weeks we'd be travel buddies, and I was seriously excited about it.

After a purchase of some Lonely planet guides we started to trade ideas. We shared many blog posts that we'd read & gleaned ideas from (all of which I'll share in a later post), and eventually settled on the following itinerary, and whilst it might not be perfect for everyone it mostly fitted what we wanted to achieve pretty well.

### Itinerary

As you can seen we planned on cramming plenty in, it helps that neither of us is shy when it comes to walking and exploring. With hindsight I guess my only regret is not spending a little more time in Melbourne, but there will be time for that in the future. I'll make damn sure of that!
