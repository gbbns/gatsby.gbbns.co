## Goals for 2018
* Principal FE promotion
* Take at least one holiday, either in the UK or abroad
* Write more: Aim to publish at least 6 main blog posts in the year, as well as 12 shorter posts in the 'latest notes' section
* Speak at at least one of the following: a local (Manchester) meetup, speak at a (UK) meetup, or speak at a conference
* Keep my website up to date
* Start my bucket list website

Looking at the list of &rsquo;goals&lsquo; that I set myself I&rsquo;m pretty happy, overall, with how things panned out.x
