## Goals for 2018

* Principal FE promotion
* Take at least one holiday, either in the UK or abroad
* Write more: Aim to publish at least 6 main blog posts in the year, as well as 12 shorter posts in the 'latest notes' section
* Speak at at least one of the following: a local (Manchester) meetup, speak at a (UK) meetup, or speak at a conference
* Keep my website up to date
* Start my bucket list website

Looking at the list of &rsquo;goals&lsquo; that I set myself I&rsquo;m pretty happy, overall, with how things actually panned out.

Without diving into all of the points, here is what I class as my top achievements.

## Principal promotion

This has been, without a doubt, my primary objective since joining Auto Trader two years ago.

I spent some time reflecting on my careers and in all honessty was pretty bummed not have have been given this promotion earlier. Looking at the reasons why this hasn't happened seemed to highlight a few things for me:

* Staying in a job too long
* Not creating the right opportunities around me
* Being too blas√© about my role and therefore not pushing myself enough

Thankfully, after doing this exercise and regaining a bif of focus, my efforts finally seemed to get noticed and in July I was given the news I had _finally_ been successful.

## Taking _at least_ one holiday

Australia!

I have copious notes and photos from my two weeks in Australia; I'm currently piecing them together all together into a more detailed journal of my trip.

## Public speaking

I set out at the start of 2018 with the aim of speaking publically at least once... I'm pretty proud/chuffed to say that I achieved this by speaking 3 times!

## One final thing

I've migrated my site from Hugo, over to Gatsby. Early indications are that it's the right move, for me at least. A further post will detail the whys and wherefores.
