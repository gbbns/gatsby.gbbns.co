This blog post is by no means going to cover the entire year, in-fact it may be irrelevant before it even gets published, all I will say is that this year is shaping up to be a good one, I can feel it.

Towards the end of last year I had a period of reflection. I looked back at what I had achieved during the year, as well as having an eye on what I wished to develop in the coming year &mdash; both personally and professionally.

I&rsquo;ve a long list of skills I wish to develop:

* [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* More advanced features of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* Revisit and emphasise core HTML5 and CSS3 skills
* Continue to look into [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and it's more intermediate/advanced uses
* JavaScript. Not jQuery, but pure unadulterated JavaScript.
* FE workflow = Grunt//Gulp

Trying to keep up to date with new tech, as well as ensure your key skills don&rsquo;t suffer, is such a difficult balance to strike. Everytime I load up [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_gbbns) a new technology or technique seems to be mentioned &mdash; probably more than I could ever wish to learn in two lifetimes.

It&rsquo;s only when I look at the list again that I realise there is a lot there; Maybe I&rsquo;ll trim it down, maybe I won&rsquo;t.

Outside of work, photography is top of my list, by a long long way.

I&rsquo;ve recently become a Dad for the first time, this is such an ace feeling, and one that has really helped to focus what I actually want out of life. I can&rsquo;t wait to see how the little guy develops, already I can see how much he changes day to day.

Finally, I&rsquo;m going to be setting up a side project to keep my out of work focus &mdash; and to some degree life focuses &mdash; alive. Having recently turned 34, hardly old I know, it dawned on me that I&rsquo;m nearly ready for my [midlife crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlife_crisis). Hopefully I can share more on this soon, but essentially it will be a list of items I wish to achieve before I hit a certain milestone.

All in all this excites me, a lot.
