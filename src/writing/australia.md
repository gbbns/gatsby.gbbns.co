It's been 6 months since I had my first taste of Australia. 6 long months.

A lot has happened since then, but I can't stop thinking about those two weeks. It was everything I had hoped it would be, and more.

## They say to never meet your heroes

It was the last Sunday in Septemeber and I'd just left Preston station on board the train down to Euston.

Quitely drinking my coffee, I started to contemplate the next few days. I couldn't quite get my head around the prospect that within a few days not only would I be in [Melbourne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne), but I would be in a country that for as long as I can remember, I have yearned to go to.

## Plans

I have many _many_ notes from my two-week trip which I'm slowly turning into articles which will appear on this site when published which will be roughly broken down into the following sections:

- Part 1: The plan &amp; the dream
- Part 2: Melbourne
- Part 3: Great Ocean Road
- Part 4: Back in Melbs, onwards to Sydney
- Part 5: Sydney
- Part 6: The journey home
- Part 7: Reflections
- Part 8: Resources and stuff that I've found helpful

So with that, I'm off to continue writing part one - stay tuned, folks!
