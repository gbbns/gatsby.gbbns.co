So, after countless promises over the past few years, here we are!

I&rsquo;ve finally got round to sorting out my new site, it&rsquo;s now running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and is an absolute breeze to keep up to date.

Hopefully as time progresses I&rsquo;ll get round to adding a little more colour, as well as more blog posts - as I have plenty planned...
