The &rdquo;New Adventures&ldquo; conference was one I always regretted never attending. Circumstances, and views of employers at the time, meant it was never a viable opportunity and I looked longingly at Twitter whilst people waxed lyrical about the event, the friendships made, the content shared and the overall experience that [Colly](https://www.colly.com) worked tirelessly to achieve.

## My new adventure

I'm a week on from the conference trying to make sense &amp; distil things, but my mind is still buzzing from the _many_ thoughts provoked from the superb lineup of speakers.

### The fringe

The fringe events are an integral part of the festivies for New Adventures, and despite sporting a knee injury, the bowling was a great spectacle and certainly got folk in the right frame of mind for the following day.
