					Sometimes I get asked what 'what make is that', 'where did you get that from' or just what tools etc. I use day to day, and after reading the [uses page of at Wes Bos' site](https://wesbos.com/uses) I thought I'd shamelessly copy the format :)

					## Editor + Terminal
					Currently using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), yes I have tried [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Atom](https://atom.io/) et al. but I keep finding myself heading back to VS Code. I love the speed of it, I love the extensions, but overall after 8+ years of using the [grown up Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) it feels very familiar.

					Until recently (the last 3 or so years) I've never really done things via the command line, however I now use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/)

					## Apps

					* Sketch & Zeplin
					* Spotify
					* SourceTree (I told you I'm a n00b to the command line)
					* Evernote/OneNote (One for work, one for personal)
					* Photoshop
					* Lightroom
					* Chrome
					* TweetDeck
					* DropBox

					## Desk Setup
					I'm yet to find a desk I truly love -- either to buy or to build -- so in the meantime I have the [IKEA Malm desk with pull out panel](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/desks/desk-computer-desks/malm-desk-with-pull-out-panel-oak-veneer-art-00214181/) which, I have to say, I am super impressed with.

					I sit on an [IKEA MARKUS](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/chairs-stools-benches/office-chairs/markus-swivel-chair-glose-black-art-20103101/) which I was lucky enough to get free in an office clearance.

					The other chair in my office is the iconic [IKEA POÃ„NG](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/sofas-armchairs/armchairs/po%C3%A4ng-armchair-birch-veneer-finnsta-grey-spr-59090452/) this is my 'go-to' for relaxing/reading/playing video games.

					## Other gear

					### Tech
					I've finally got back into the world of console gaming and now have a [Sony PlayStation 4 Pro 1 TB, White](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0776Y3WBV?tag=amz-mkt-chr-uk-21&ascsubtag=1ba00-01000-a0049-mac00-other-nomod-uk000-pcomp-feature-scomp&ref=bit_scomp_sav0).
					Given the fact I've not been in the gaming arena for quite a few years I have quite an exhaustive back catalogue of games to get through.

					My current list is:

					* [Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Uncharted-Nathan-Drake-Collection-PS4/dp/B00KJFDSJQ)
					* [Gran Turismo: Sport](https://www.amazon.co.uk/PlayStation-9827450-Gran-Turismo-Sport/dp/B00ZG1SVA4)
					* [Ratchet and Clank](https://www.amazon.co.uk/PlayStation-3392406-Ratchet-and-Clank/dp/B00ZG1TE1Y)
					* [Horizon: Zero Dawn Standard Edition](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-Standard-Edition/dp/B00ZG1S88E/)
					* [The Last of Us Remastered](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Last-Us-Remastered-PS4/dp/B00JK00S0S/)
					* [Tomb Raider Definitive Edition](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tomb-Raider-Definitive-Edition-PS4/dp/B00H8IVL6O/)

					Due to the fact that I have a 4hr commute (~2hrs each way) I like to keep a charge on me all the time, enter the [Anker PowerCore 20100](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-PowerCore-20100-Capacity-Technology-Black/dp/B00VJSGT2A) it suits my requirements to the ground, gives me numerous charges for my various devices and weighs pretty much nothing.

					Keeping on the commute subject, I try to dip into reading when I can -- or when I get motivated _- so the obvious choice, aside from physical books, was to get an [Amazon Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-6-Inch-4GB-E-Reader/dp/B00QJDO0QC/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1505463193&sr=1-1&keywords=kindle+paperwhite)

					### Coffee
					Coffee has become an integral part of my day, not just because _caffeine_ but because I really enjoy it.

					My current kit consists of:

					* [Aerobie AeroPress](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Aerobie-AeroPress-80R11-Coffee-Maker/dp/B000GXZ2GS/)
					* [Porlex hand grinder](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Porlex-Mini-Hand-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B01B77O8FM)
					* [KeepCup](https://www.amazon.co.uk/KeepCup-Brew-12oz-Medium-Cocoa/dp/B01D8IPRA8/)

					With my coffee choices varying, but usually from either [ManCoCo](https://mancoco.co.uk/) or [Atkinsons](https://thecoffeehopper.com/).

					### Stationery
					Currently rocking the [Nock Brasstown](https://nockco.com/cases/brasstown) pencil case. It's amazing. It wasn't cheap -- as I had to get it imported, then had to pay import duty on it :( -- but it's totally worth it, and always gets noticed.

					I love to write in the superb [Leuchtturm 1917](https://www.leuchtturm1917.co.uk/notebooks/) notepads. I used to use [Moleskines](https://www.moleskine.com/gb/), but the Leuchtturm has fainter lines on the paper, which I like.

					I write with either [Pilot G-tec C4](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pilot-Microtip-Rollerball-Black-Pack/dp/B008LUQX9S) or the [Muji gel ink pens](https://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=13&Sub=52) though my ultimate goal is a [Mont Blanc](https://www.montblanc.com/en-gb/home.html)

					### Bags

					* [Home of Millican](https://www.homeofmillican.com/) :
					 * [Smith the roll pack - 25l](https://www.homeofmillican.com/collections/maverick-collection/products/the-mavericks-smith-the-roll-pack-25l-slate#product)
					 * [Rob the traveller](https://vimeo.com/47250849)
					 * [Christopher X Fuji](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Camera-Photo/Fujifilm-Millican-Christopher-Antique-Bronze-large-insert/B00NHOKON4)

					I also have the [Thule Blur2](https://www.thule.com/en-gb/gb/backpacks/laptop-backpacks/thule-enroute-blur-2-_-3203402) but I'm not entirely satisfied with it. It replaced my old The North Face but has never felt as good as it.

					### Photography
					This year (2017) I traded in my [Canon 40D](hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_40D) for a [pre-owned Fuji X-T1](https://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_t1/)

					Current lenses:

					* [18mm f2](https://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf18mmf2_r/)
					* [35mm f2](https://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf35mmf2_r_wr/)
					* [18-55mm f2.8-4](https://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf18_55mmf28_4_r_lm_ois/)

					My pictures can currently be seen over at:

					* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_gbbns/)
					* [500px](https://500px.com/gbbns)
					* itakepictur.es (coming soon)

					### Other
					I'm pretty agnostic when it comes to devices. Over the years I've had all the main players, my current phone is the [One+3T](https://oneplus.net/uk/3t)
